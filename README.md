## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - Store library for vue

### Continued development

I'll be practicing more the use of Vue, since there's a lot of room to learn and develop better practices on views, reusable components, as well as Pinia and it's stores concept.

### Useful resources

- [Learn Vue](https://learnvue.co/) - This helped me understand several concepts. Also, it's a good source, along with the official documentation, of tutorials, articles and their Youtube Channel is a good help to understand and get things done.
